# Status

Where things stand. Rewrite (don't append) at the end of each working session.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-10. **Released:** 0.10.0 (app and server).

## Waiting on the owner
- Setting up the rented server by following `docs/hosting.md` (buy domain,
  Hetzner Ashburn VPS, run `deploy/install.sh`, copy `data/` and the settings
  file, set `max_storage_mb = 30000`). Not done by Claude: no accounts or
  purchases without him. `install.sh` was syntax-checked only; its first real
  run is on his VPS (no systemd in the cloud workspace).

## In 0.10.0
- Full history: `server/src/history.rs` keeps the recent `history_limit` in
  memory, appends older ones to `data/history/<channel>.jsonl`, answers
  `loadOlder` with pages of 50 (`olderMessages`, feature `olderMessages`).
  Archived files stay downloadable and count for the storage limit; admin
  delete works on archived messages (in-place tombstone). Client:
  `client/src/history_ui.rs` asks when the list top is in view, keeps the
  view on the previous first message, shows "This is the start of #x".
  Checked: `tests/test_history.py` (16 checks), unit test, Wine (scrolled 40
  messages back to the start).
- Storage warning: `server/src/storage.rs` (moved `enforce` there from
  files.rs) warns admins at 80%/95% of `max_storage_mb` or of the disk
  (statvfs / GetDiskFreeSpaceExW), at sign-in, after uploads and each minute;
  app shows a bar above the chat (Wine screenshot taken). Sizes under 1 GB
  shown in MB.
- Linux server: release builds `TUFFcord-server-linux-x86_64` on a pinned
  ubuntu-24.04 runner; Linux servers install their own updates; SIGTERM
  (systemctl stop) saves and exits. Hosting guide `docs/hosting.md`, installer
  `deploy/install.sh` (Caddy, ufw, systemd unit with HOST=127.0.0.1).

## Next for hosting (after the owner's server is up)
- Watch the first self-update on the VPS (journal should show the restart).
- Optional, later: HTTPS built into the server (drops Caddy, ~30 MB).

## In 0.9.3 (owner confirmed all three on his PC, 2026-10-10)
- Video previews (`client/src/posters.rs`, `media::is_dark`): the sender's
  probe skips near-black frames; a received poster that is near-black,
  missing or unfetchable is replaced by a frame taken from the cached clip
  (one job at a time, saved as `<id>.jpg` in the cache, retried when the
  clip's download ends). Big clips that aren't preloaded stay black until
  played. Failures are logged ("No preview frame ...").
- Middle-click auto scroll (`client/src/autoscroll.rs`): stops on any click,
  Esc, middle again or a channel change; off when push-to-talk is the middle
  button; stick-to-bottom is off while it runs.
- Mute, deafen, settings: `widgets::bar_button`, a highlight mixed from the
  bar color that fades in, so it shows in light themes too.

## In 0.9.2
- Sidebar and member list widths: drag the edge between them and the chat
  (`widgets::panel_edge`, called last in `main_screen` so it wins the hit
  test; line lights up on hover, accent while dragging). Saved in
  `Settings.sidebar_width` / `members_width` (200-420 / 180-400, chat keeps
  360) when the drag ends. Client only.
- Admins (feature `"channelEdit"`): right-click a channel for Rename (box in
  place of the row, Enter/Esc) and Delete (confirm dialog); drag a channel
  within its list to reorder, applied locally at once and sent as
  `moveChannel`. Server (`server/src/channels.rs`): admin checked per
  account, rename moves history (and `message.channel`) and people in voice
  (`Channels.renamed` for new apps, `VoiceJoined` for 0.9.1 apps), delete
  removes a text channel's messages and files or moves people out of voice,
  the last channel of a kind can't be deleted, all saved via
  `config::save_channels`. Checked: `tests/test_channels.py` (29 checks),
  Wine screenshots of every step.

## In 0.9.1
- Admins add text and voice channels from the app: "+" by each list heading
  opens a name box (Enter adds, Esc cancels); `client/src/channels_ui.rs`,
  `server/src/channels.rs`. Server cleans the name (text: lowercase, dashes),
  refuses duplicates and more than 50 per kind, saves both lists into the
  settings file (`config::save_channels`, keeps other lines; creates the
  default file when there's none) and sends `Channels` to everyone. New
  protocol: `createChannel`, `channels`, feature `"channels"` (older servers
  don't show the "+"). The creator's app opens the new text channel. Checked: `tests/test_channels.py`, unit
  test for the file rewrite, Wine screenshots, owner's PC.
- Member list slides open/shut in 150 ms (`members.rs`, laid out at full
  width and clipped while it moves); repaints only during the slide.

## In 0.9.0
- Preload (`client/src/downloads.rs`): video/audio attachments visible in the
  open channel and at most `Settings.preload_mb` (default 50, 0 = off) download
  in the background, one at a time, no progress shown until Play is pressed;
  a failed preload isn't retried (`no_preload`), Play still works. Settings,
  Appearance and videos, "Downloads": preload slider (0-200 MB), cache size
  (`cache_mb`, 0.25-20 GB, default 2 GB) and space in use. Cache is pruned
  (oldest first) at start, after each download and when the size changes.
  Checked under Wine: a clip sent by the bot landed in the cache without
  Play; Settings page shown. Not done: streaming while downloading (option B
  in `analysis/media-caching-options.md`) for big files.
- Main window opens at its last size, place and maximized state (also after
  an update restart): `Settings.window`, tracked each frame by
  `App::remember_window` and applied by `main_viewport` (both `update_ui.rs`),
  saved on close and before the update restart; confirmed through the 0.9.1
  update. Not guarded against a monitor that was unplugged since (window could
  open off screen).
- Settings window can be dragged (opens centered via `pivot`/`default_pos`
  instead of `anchor`). Both checked under Wine.

## Earlier
- The video freeze (0.8.2: app and Windows volume mixer hung a
  few seconds into a video) is fixed and confirmed on the owner's machine:
  lock-order deadlock in `media.rs` (0.8.3, see troubleshooting); 0.8.5 resets
  the fallbacks the freeze had switched on and adds a "Play videos here again"
  button. The friend's earlier 0.7.1 "crash" may have been the same bug.

## Workspace (since 2026-10-10)
- Repo is in the project settings and the project uses the "TUFFcord" cloud
  environment, whose setup script installs the toolchain before a thread starts
  (source: `analysis/cloud-env-setup.sh` in the project files). A check thread
  confirmed: auto clone, tools present, CLAUDE.md loaded, doctor ran. Windows
  `.exe` builds work there since `tools/setup.sh` builds Rust's missing Windows
  startup objects (2026-10-10); the app runs under Wine, audio plays.
- `tools/setup.sh` only before building or testing (~5 min bare, all passing).

## In 0.8.6
- Settings window: categories on the left (`SettingsPage` in
  `settings_window.rs`), the chosen page on the right at a fixed height.
- `media_default` (Settings, 50% for everyone) is the volume each clip opens
  at; `media_level` is now the playing clip's volume only and isn't saved.
- "Play videos here again" always shown, disabled when `play_outside` is
  empty, with a tooltip. Checked under Wine (all four pages, tooltip).

## In 0.8.5
- One-time reset of `video_gpu` / `play_outside` (settings.rs `load`), Settings
  button to clear `play_outside`.

## In 0.8.4
- Rename finished: crates `tuffcord`/`tuffcord-server`, programs `TUFFcord`,
  `TUFFcord-server`, `tuffcord-bot`. Copies started as `backroom*.exe` rename
  themselves (`proto::update::adopt_new_name`; checked under Wine and in the
  selfupdate suite); the server's `data/backroom.log` becomes `TUFFcord.log`.
  Kept for old copies: env var names, `--version` wording, `backroom*.exe`
  release copies, old repo fallback. Users may need to remake shortcuts and
  re-allow the server in the Windows firewall.

## In 0.8.3
- Video freeze fix (`client/src/media.rs`): never call the engine while
  holding `shared`.

## In 0.8.2
- Chat messages get a subtle highlight under the pointer (Discord style).
- Video and audio players: the volume bar is now a vertical popup above the
  speaker button, shown while it's hovered (`client/src/volume_ui.rs`); click
  still mutes, scroll still changes volume. Checked under Wine on the audio
  player; the video bar uses the same code but Wine shows no video picture.

## Check early next session
- `tests/run.py --compat` in the Release workflow: first runs on the next release.
- Small fix pending: when `gh api` is refused, `tools/doctor.sh` prints GitHub's
  JSON error into its status line; send gh's errors to /dev/null and print `?`.

## Undecided options (from the efficiency review)
Full review with token estimates: `analysis/token-efficiency-review.md` in the
project files (2026-10-10). Client `main.rs` split done 2026-10-10 (D, client
half): 8 modules, settings window one function per section, rules in CLAUDE.md
"Where new code goes", doctor lists files over 1,000 lines. No behavior change;
build, Windows check and all e2e suites passed; no Wine screenshot taken.
Owner wants to revisit H next.

- C: support only current + previous version; drop pre-0.7 compatibility code.
- D (server half): split server `main.rs` (1.5k lines) when it grows; cuts:
  voice, history, attachments.
- E: automated UI tests (egui renders without a window) instead of screenshots.
- H: keep the built-in video player, or open videos in the system player.
